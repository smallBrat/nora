## Standards & isolation

- **MCP — shipped.** A control-plane [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server (`@noraai/mcp-server`, published to the official [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry)) plus per-agent MCP server management — operate the fleet from Claude Code / Desktop / Cursor, and wire MCP tools into individual agents.
- **OpenTelemetry GenAI — on the roadmap.** OTLP export of runtime telemetry under the `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions, so agent traces and per-agent token/cost attribution flow into the Grafana / Datadog / Langfuse stack you already run.
- **A2A — on the roadmap.** Agent Cards / Agent-to-Agent discovery for managed OpenClaw and Hermes agents.
- **Isolation, per deploy target.** Standard Docker and Kubernetes runs use container namespaces plus operator-set CPU / RAM / disk limits; the experimental **NemoClaw** profile hardens untrusted code with a non-root user, all Linux capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, Landlock + seccomp, and default-deny egress; Proxmox VM placement (planned) is the future hardware-isolation tier. See the [isolation model](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/concepts/security#runtime-isolation).

## What Is Nora?

Nora is the self-hosted AI agent ops platform for running autonomous agent fleets on infrastructure you control, whether you standardize on OpenClaw, Hermes, or keep both available in the same operator surface.

Most teams running agents in production eventually rebuild the same layer around the runtime itself: deploy workflows, secrets, monitoring, logs, terminal, Agent Hub templating, and a separate admin surface. Nora exists so that layer doesn't have to be rewritten every time the runtime conversation changes.

In one place: deploy OpenClaw and Hermes runtimes, migrate existing runtimes via uploaded bundles or live Docker/SSH inspection, manage provider keys with sync to running runtimes, validate agents through runtime-specific surfaces, browse and edit live runtime files, install Agent Hub starter templates, review monitoring and account event history, and connect channels and integrations from the same control plane. Operator workflows live under `/app`; platform-wide admin lives under `/admin`.

→ [Why Nora](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/introduction#why-teams-choose-nora) · [Runtime model](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/concepts/runtimes) · [Deployment footprint](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/concepts/architecture#deployment-topologies)

## Quick Start

**macOS / Linux / WSL2:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solomon2773/nora/master/setup.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solomon2773/nora/master/setup.ps1 | iex
```

> **Windows requires [PowerShell 7+](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).** The default Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not supported — run the command above from a `pwsh` 7 session.

The installer verifies prerequisites, generates or preserves secrets, optionally creates a bootstrap admin, picks free local ports when the defaults are busy, and starts the stack. Once it finishes, open the URL printed by setup. Local mode defaults to `http://localhost:8080`, but setup may select another port such as `8081` on a busy workstation. Then follow the [first-15-minutes walkthrough](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/quickstart).

For manual setup, environment variables, public-domain mode, TLS, Kubernetes, NemoClaw, and planned Proxmox configuration, see the docs:

- [Self-hosting guide](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/self-hosting)
- [Environment variables reference](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/configuration/environment-variables)
- [Provisioner backends](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/configuration/provisioner-backends) (Docker and k3s/Kubernetes are GA; NemoClaw is experimental; Proxmox is planned)
- [TLS and public domains](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/configuration/tls-domains)
- [Fronting a launch with Cloudflare](infra/cloudflare-launch.md) — edge caching, rate limiting, and spike absorption for the single-host deploy

## Public REST API, CLI, and MCP

Workspace-scoped API keys (bearer-only, prefixed `nora_`, HMAC-hashed at rest, scope-based) drive a stable subset of the REST surface. Issue keys at `/app/workspaces/<id>/api-keys`.

```bash
export NORA_TOKEN="nora_..."
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NORA_TOKEN" https://your-nora.example.com/api/agents
```

A small CLI lives in [`cli/`](./cli) (`@noraai/cli`): run `nora login` once to save your host and API token, then `nora workspaces`, `nora agents`, and `nora monitoring` wrap the same REST surface. `nora doctor` runs an admin-only control-plane health check, and `nora mcp` launches the MCP stdio server. See the [API reference](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/api/overview) for the supported endpoints and scopes.

**Operate Nora from Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or Cursor:** the [`mcp-server/`](./mcp-server) package (`@noraai/mcp-server`) exposes the same API as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools — deploy agents, control their lifecycle, and read fleet metrics, events, and per-agent cost from any MCP client. Destructive deletion stays disabled unless explicitly opted in.

```bash
claude mcp add nora \
  --env NORA_API_URL=https://your-nora.example.com \
  --env NORA_API_KEY=nora_... \
  -- npx -y @noraai/mcp-server
```

See the [MCP guide](https://noradocs.solomontsao.com/guides/mcp-server) for Claude Desktop/Cursor config, the tool list, and security notes.

## Roadmap

Current roadmap items:

- **High priority - NemoClaw experimental hardening:** mature the experimental secure-sandbox profile across enablement, NVIDIA key and model configuration, OpenShell policy controls, approvals, gateway health, logs, terminal access, telemetry, and end-to-end validation.
- **Proxmox execution target:** complete the planned LXC deployment path for standard, Hermes, and NemoClaw-backed runtimes, with stronger API/SSH validation, template handling, lifecycle operations, log streaming, telemetry, and smoke coverage.
- **Hermes/OpenClaw parity:** close runtime gaps across validation, deployment readiness, logs, terminal access, monitoring, integration setup, and failure reporting.
- **First-run operator UX:** tighten the setup path for workspaces, LLM providers, provisioning backends, the first agent deploy, and recommended smoke checks.
- **Account-scoped monitoring:** add account-level health views that roll up workspace, agent, runtime, cost, and alert signals with drill-downs where operators need detail.
- **Auth and key-sync hardening:** strengthen session and API-key boundaries, provider key propagation, audit trails, key rotation, and recovery from partial sync failures.
- **Agent Hub ergonomics:** improve template discovery, install/configure flows, version metadata, setup guidance, and post-install validation.

## Development

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f backend-api

# Tests
cd backend-api && npx jest --no-watchman
cd e2e && npm test
```
