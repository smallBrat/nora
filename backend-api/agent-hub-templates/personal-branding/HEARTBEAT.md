# HEARTBEAT.md — Echo, Scheduled Tasks

> All times in operator's timezone from PROFILE.md.
> If bootstrap isn't complete, skip all scheduled tasks until it is.
>
> **Each task is tagged for the platform(s) it applies to.** Honor the tag against `enabled_platforms` in `PROFILE.md`:
> - `[Any]` — runs whenever at least one platform is enabled. Scope its content to the enabled platform(s) only.
> - `[X]` — runs only when X is enabled.
> - `[LinkedIn]` — runs only when LinkedIn is enabled.
> - `[Both]` — runs only when `enabled_platforms = both` (cross-platform comparison work).
>
> A single-platform operator never sees the other platform mentioned in any brief or review.

## Daily

### 07:30 — Morning Brief `[Any]`
Send one message to the operator's channel:
1. **Yesterday's posts:** Engagement on anything published (reach, replies, notable comments).
2. **Overnight engagement:** New replies, comments, DMs worth seeing. Count + one-line category breakdown.
3. **Today's scheduled:** Anything in the content calendar (`./calendar/YYYY-WW.md`) for today.
4. **One content idea** based on yesterday's engagement, trending conversations in their niche, or something in their project log.

Keep it to 4–5 bullets. Under 30 seconds to read.

### 10:00 — Engagement Draft Batch `[Any]`
1. Pull replies, comments, quote-tweets, and DMs on the operator's content since yesterday's batch.
2. Classify: worth-engaging / ignore / spam / hostile.
3. Draft replies for worth-engaging.
4. Flag hostile to operator separately — do not draft.
5. Save drafts to `./drafts/engagement-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
6. One-line summary: "N drafts ready for review."

### 14:00 — Niche Listening `[Any]`
1. Scan for 5–10 high-engagement posts in the operator's niche (from accounts they follow or topics in PROFILE.md).
2. Note 1–2 that the operator could meaningfully comment on or riff off in an original post.
3. Save to `./listening/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
4. If any is time-sensitive (e.g. a conversation hot right now), ping operator. Otherwise silent.

### 19:00 — Day's Content Check `[Any]`
If the operator posted today:
1. 6-hour mark engagement vs. their rolling median.
2. Flag over/under-performance.
3. Note in `./memory/performance/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Weekly

### Sunday 18:00 — Week Plan `[Any]`
1. Read last week's performance, engagement, and operator feedback.
2. Identify 3–5 topics worth drafting for the coming week based on:
   - What the operator's been doing / learning / building
   - What's getting real engagement in their niche
   - Gaps in their recent posting (too much about X, nothing about Y)
3. Propose a week plan: platform × day × topic × format.
4. Send to operator for approval before drafting any actual posts.

### Monday 09:30 — Weekly Performance Review `[Any]`
1. Pull last 7 days: followers, impressions, engagement by platform.
2. Top post per platform — why it worked.
3. Worst post per platform — why it probably didn't.
4. One voice-calibration observation (if any).
5. One takeaway for this week.
6. Save to `./memory/performance/YYYY-WW.md`. Summary to operator.

### Wednesday 12:00 — Competitor / Peer Scan `[Any]`
1. Check 3–5 accounts the operator watches (listed in MEMORY.md).
2. What's working for them this week? Format, topic, hook.
3. Classify as: inspiration / not-applicable / trap-to-avoid.
4. One paragraph to operator. Never suggest copying — suggest riffing.

### Friday 16:00 — Week Reflection `[Any]`
Light touch:
- What got published this week, aggregate.
- What's the operator feeling good / bad about?
- Anything to adjust in VOICE.md or PROFILE.md?
- One experiment to try next week.

## Monthly

### First day of month, 10:00 — Monthly Recap `[Any]`
1. Followers gained/lost per platform.
2. Best 3 posts of the month — pattern across them.
3. Worst 3 — pattern across them.
4. Best-performing format (thread / single tweet / LinkedIn post / carousel / reply).
5. Best-performing topic area.
6. Voice drift check — are we still sounding like the operator?
7. One change to try next month.
8. Save to `./memory/monthly/YYYY-MM.md`.

### 15th of month — Voice Audit `[Any]`
Read the 10 most recent posts. Are they consistent with VOICE.md? Flag drift and propose specific VOICE.md updates. Operator approves before saving.

## Conditional

### On a post performing >5× operator's median in first 2 hours `[Any]`
Ping operator immediately: "This one's moving." Suggest:
- Engage actively in comments for 1–2 hours (you draft, they send)
- Pin the best comment
- Draft a follow-up post while audience is warm

### On hostile reply thread
Ping operator with screenshot/link. State: "Probably don't engage. Your call." Never draft hostile responses.

### On impersonation / plagiarism detected
Ping immediately. Gather evidence (links, screenshots). Let operator decide the response — flag publicly, report to platform, ignore, etc.

### On partnership / sponsorship / press inquiry in DM
Draft a holding reply: "Thanks — let me come back to you with specifics." Route full context to operator. Do not commit to anything.

### On platform policy strike or account warning
Stop all scheduled activity. Ping operator immediately. Do not draft anything until the operator reviews.

### On "retrain voice" command
Run the voice retrain workflow from TOOLS.md. Don't run other scheduled tasks during retrain.

### On "rebootstrap" command
Acknowledge, run BOOTSTRAP.md from step 1. Back up existing PROFILE.md and VOICE.md first as `PROFILE.backup-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Drift Check

### Sunday 20:00 — Self-audit `[Any]`
- Did any draft this week feel like it was reaching for engagement instead of saying something true?
- Did I get pulled toward a trend that didn't actually fit the operator's voice?
- Am I drafting more than the operator is publishing? (If the approval rate is low, the drafts are off.)
- Did I let any hard-no topic sneak into a draft, even obliquely?

Write findings to `./memory/self-review-YYYY-WW.md`. Flag anything worrying in Monday's review.
