# Putting Cloudflare in front of Nora for a launch

The reference production deploy (`/.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`) runs the
whole stack on a **single host** behind the host's own nginx + Let's Encrypt. That is
fine for steady-state operator traffic, but a Product Hunt / Reddit / LinkedIn front-page
spike points thousands of first-time visitors at the **marketing site** all at once, and
one Docker host is a single point of failure.

Putting **Cloudflare in front** is the fastest, cheapest launch mitigation:

- The marketing landing page (what the spike actually hits) is served from Cloudflare's
  **edge cache**, so the origin barely sees the surge.
- Cloudflare absorbs **DDoS / bot** traffic and gives you a one-click **"Under Attack"**
  switch.
- It does **not** remove the origin SPOF — for real HA you still want a second origin
  behind a load balancer later (see [Beyond launch](#beyond-launch)) — but it removes the
  most likely launch-day failure mode.

> Time to set up: ~30 minutes. Everything below is on Cloudflare's **free** plan.

## Prerequisites

- The apex/subdomain (`nora.solomontsao.com`) is managed on Cloudflare nameservers.
- The origin already serves a **valid Let's Encrypt cert** (it does — `infra/setup-tls.sh`),
  which lets us use the strict TLS mode below.
- You know the origin's public IP (the `DEPLOY_HOST`).

`noradocs.solomontsao.com` is hosted by Mintlify and needs none of this.

---

## Step 1 — DNS (proxy the origin)

In **Cloudflare → DNS**, the record for `nora.solomontsao.com` (A → origin IPv4, and
AAAA if you have IPv6) must be **Proxied** (orange cloud), not "DNS only" (grey).

Grey cloud = traffic bypasses Cloudflare entirely. Orange cloud = caching, WAF, and DDoS
protection are active. The grey cloud is also your instant rollback (Step 8).

## Step 2 — TLS mode

**Cloudflare → SSL/TLS → Overview → Full (strict).**

Because the origin has a real Let's Encrypt cert, Full (strict) validates it end-to-end.
Do **not** use "Flexible" (it sends plaintext to the origin and breaks secure cookies).

Also enable **SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates → Always Use HTTPS** and **Automatic HTTPS
Rewrites**. You can turn on **HSTS** here instead of (or in addition to) the commented
HSTS line in `infra/nginx_tls.conf`.

## Step 3 — Restore the real client IP at the origin (required)

Behind Cloudflare, nginx sees **Cloudflare's** edge IPs as the client. That silently
breaks the per-IP rate limiting added in `nginx_tls.conf` / `nginx_public.conf.template`
(`auth_limit` / `api_limit`): every visitor would share a handful of Cloudflare IPs, so a
single edge IP could trip the limit for everyone.

Both nginx templates ship a ready-to-enable block. **Uncomment** the
`# ── Cloudflare real client IP restoration ──` section (the `set_real_ip_from …` ranges,
`real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;`, `real_ip_recursive on;`), confirm the ranges against
<https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/>, then regenerate + reload:

```bash
# regenerate nginx.public.conf from the template and reload
DOMAIN=nora.solomontsao.com ./infra/setup-tls.sh    # or re-run your deploy
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f infra/docker-compose.public-prod.yml -f infra/docker-compose.public-tls.yml \
  exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

Verify: after enabling, `docker compose ... logs nginx` should show **real visitor IPs**,
not `104.16.x.x` / `172.64.x.x`.

> Hardening (recommended): once all traffic is via Cloudflare, lock the origin firewall so
> `:443` only accepts Cloudflare's IP ranges (or enable **Authenticated Origin Pulls**).
> That stops attackers from bypassing the edge by hitting the origin IP directly.

## Step 4 — Cache the marketing site at the edge

Cloudflare does **not** cache HTML by default — you must make it eligible. In
**Cloudflare → Caching → Cache Rules**, create two rules (top-down; first is evaluated
first):

**Rule 1 — "Bypass dynamic + authenticated" (priority 1):**

- If **any** of:
  - URI Path starts with `/api/`
  - URI Path starts with `/app/`
  - URI Path starts with `/admin/`
  - URI Path is in `/signup`, `/login`
  - Cookie contains your Nora session cookie name
- Then: **Bypass cache.**

This keeps the API (including the `/api/ws/` log/terminal sockets and the
`/api/agents/*/gateway/chat` SSE stream), the operator app, the admin app, and every
authenticated or cookie-setting response **off** the edge cache. Never cache a response
that carries `Set-Cookie`.

**Rule 2 — "Cache marketing" (priority 2):**

- If: Request Method is `GET` (everything not already bypassed by Rule 1)
- Then: **Eligible for cache**, **Edge TTL: Override → 5 minutes** (raise once you trust
  it), **Browser TTL: Respect origin**.

`/_next/static/*`, `/og-image.png`, favicons, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` are immutable
or public and cache cleanly. The landing page now serves from the edge, so the spike no
longer reaches the Node process.

> Verify with `curl -sI https://nora.solomontsao.com/ | grep -i cf-cache-status` →
> should become `HIT` after the first request. The same header on `/api/...` must read
> `BYPASS` or `DYNAMIC`.

## Step 5 — Edge rate limiting (defense in depth)

**Cloudflare → Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules.** Add at least:

- **Login protection:** path `/api/auth/login` (and `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/oauth-login`)
  → more than ~10 requests / minute / IP → **Block** for 1 minute. This sits in front of
  the nginx `auth_limit` (5 r/s) and the Express `authLimiter` — three layers.

The free plan includes one rate-limiting rule; use it on the auth surface, the most
abused path.

## Step 6 — Streaming caveat (read before launch)

Nora streams in two places that pass through `/api/` and are therefore **bypassed** by
Rule 1 (correct — never cache these):

- **WebSocket** (`/api/ws/` logs & terminal): Cloudflare proxies WebSockets fine on
  proxied records. No action needed.
- **SSE** (`/api/agents/*/gateway/chat`): Cloudflare passes Server-Sent Events through,
  but the **free plan can drop a connection after ~100s** of an idle stream. The origin
  sets `proxy_read_timeout 300` for this path; behind Cloudflare a long, quiet chat stream
  may be cut early and the client will reconnect. This affects only **logged-in operators**
  (a small fraction of launch-day traffic, which is dominated by the cached marketing
  page), so it is acceptable for launch — just **test it** (Step 7) and know the behavior.

## Step 7 — Pre-launch verification checklist

Run these against the live site **before** you post anywhere:

- [ ] `curl -sI https://nora.solomontsao.com/ | grep -i cf-cache-status` → `HIT` on a
      second request.
- [ ] `curl -sI https://nora.solomontsao.com/api/health | grep -i cf-cache-status` →
      `BYPASS`/`DYNAMIC` (never `HIT`).
- [ ] Sign up for a fresh account end-to-end (no cached/stale auth page; cookie sets).
- [ ] Log into `/app` and confirm the dashboard + a WebSocket log stream work.
- [ ] Open an agent chat and confirm SSE streaming works (note the ~100s caveat).
- [ ] OAuth login (Google/GitHub) round-trips (callbacks go through the marketing app).
- [ ] `docker compose ... logs nginx` shows **real client IPs**, not Cloudflare IPs.
- [ ] Trip the login rate limit intentionally and confirm a `429`/Block.

## Step 8 — During the spike & rollback

- If you see a bot/DDoS surge: **Security → Settings → Under Attack Mode: On** (challenges
  every visitor). Turn it off once the surge subsides — it adds friction for real users.
- **Instant rollback:** set the DNS record back to **DNS only** (grey cloud). Traffic goes
  straight to the origin again within DNS TTL. Keep the TTL low (e.g., 5 min / "Auto")
  around launch so you can flip quickly.

## Beyond launch

Cloudflare absorbs the spike but the **origin is still a single host**. When you want real
high availability:

1. Bump the host first (vertical scale: more vCPU/RAM, ensure swap, raise file-descriptor
   limits). The nginx templates now use `worker_processes auto` + `worker_connections 4096`,
   so nginx will use every core.
2. Stand up a **second origin** and put both behind a load balancer (Cloudflare Load
   Balancing, or an external LB), with PostgreSQL/Redis moved to managed or replicated
   instances rather than per-host containers.
3. Health-check both origins so a dead host is pulled from rotation automatically.

That removes the SPOF entirely; Cloudflare-in-front is the launch-day stopgap that buys you
the time to do it.
